# Casters - Game Documentation

## 1. Overview

Casters is a 2-player fantasy Trading Card Game where heroes duel by summoning minions, casting spells, and outsmarting each other with strategic moves. Each player builds a Main deck (30 cards; only Minion and Spell types) and a Stage deck (5 cards, each granting 5 health). The game emphasizes simultaneous play, coin-determined initiative, and engaging "mind game" decision-making.

## 2. Gameplay

### Deck Construction

- **Main Deck:**
  - 30 cards in total
  - Maximum 2 copies per card
  - Cards are either Minions or Spells
- **Stage Deck:**
  - 5 cards (only one copy per card)
  - Each Stage card represents 5 health
  - Total starting health is 25

### Game Board Zones

- **Main Deck Zone:** Holds the 30-card deck
- **Stage Deck Zone:** Displays Stage cards (serving as both health and play limit)
- **Graveyard (GY):** Where discarded or used cards go
- **Coin Indicator:** Shows initiative (1 coin for first player, 2 coins for second)

### Turn Structure

#### Pre-Game Setup

1. Decide Initiative: Flip a coin
2. Deck Preparation: Each player shuffles their decks and reveals one Stage card
3. Initial Draw: Each player draws 5 cards from their Main deck

#### Turn Phases

1. **Draw Phase:** Each player draws one card from their Main deck
2. **Set Phase:** Both players simultaneously set a number of cards face-down equal to the open Stage cards on the board
3. **Reveal Phase:** Starting with the player holding the initiative coin, players reveal one face-down card at a time
   - **Options:**
     - **Play the Card:** Pay its cost; if it's a Minion, summon it (and trigger any "On Play" effects). If it's a Spell, resolve its effect and move it to the Graveyard
     - **Discard for Draw:** Discard the card to draw 2 new cards
4. **Battle Phase:** The player with initiative may attack:
   - Choose a minion to attack either the opponent's Stage deck (hero) or a tapped enemy minion
   - Continue attacking until both players choose to skip
5. **End Phase:** The turn ends. The player with 2 coins passes one coin to the opponent, thereby changing the initiative. Any damage dealt is resolved (note that Stage cards, once lost, are permanent)

### Win Condition

A player loses when all their Stage cards (health) are removed.
